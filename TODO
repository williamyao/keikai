- Add some way to cancel out of a prompt. ^C is probably the most obvious option;
  but it makes it slighly finicky, since we didn't really want to have to handle that.
- Make the program work with resizing. This probably shouldn't be that hard, but doing
  it portably is kind of a pain.
- Add functionality to see what you need to make on an exam to get a certain grade
- Maybe add a way to see grades over time, and predict a final grade
