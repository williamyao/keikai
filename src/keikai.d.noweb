\section{Introduction}

My university has an online gradebook, which sports among its most useful
features, missing grades, inaccurate grades, and confusing interfaces.
After being told I had a grade of 3,627\% in AI, I figured it was time to
write a half-decent gradebook of my own.

\textbf{Keikai} aims to be an extremely minimal gradebook program, as well
as a demonstration of literate programming. To that end, it uses 
\texttt{ncurses} to run fast and focus on its core functionality.
